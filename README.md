## What's this?
A rudimentary stab at a [personal repository](http://dangerous-balance.surge.sh/). A Zettelkasten.

I usually save notes to myself via Google Drive, to permit accessibility between all my devices. But sometimes I have notes that seem like they want to be shared. This is my gentle attempt to build a site where I can lay these notes out in a visually appealing manner.

## Although...
I haven't yet implemented a more comprehensive sorting or organization system. Effectively this is a blog, with an attempt to slowly increase the density of links over time and to collate similar "categories" of notes together. I want to decide on a way to display posts with bucketed "id numbers" instead of the current way it displays the posts chronologically. Maybe move what is currently the home page into a page that specifically says it is for chronological display, and then instead bucket sections into categories with headings to provide more of a mind-map-style collection. 

## Frameworks
GatsbyJS as the static site generator. Uses React. 

## To Do
- [x] Get Markdown integration
- [x] Add individually published "posts"
- [ ] Group posts by chronological order in a separate page, not the home page
- [ ] Group posts on home page by buckets of categories under headings
- [ ] Content insertion #1
- [ ] Git Hooks with Surge for easier deployment

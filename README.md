# What's this?
A rudimentary stab at a [personal repository](http://dangerous-balance.surge.sh/). A Zettelkasten.

I usually save notes to myself via Google Drive, to permit accessibility between all my devices. But sometimes I have notes that seem like they want to be shared. This is my gentle attempt to build a site where I can lay these notes out in a visually appealing manner.

# Frameworks
GatsbyJS as the static site generator. Uses React.

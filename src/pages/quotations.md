Adam Lindsay Gordon:

>Life is mostly froth and bubble, two things stand like stone.
>Kindness in another’s trouble, courage in your own.


Stephen Pinker:

>Equality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are
interchangeable; it is the moral principle that individuals should
not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their
group.

John Adams, in a letter to Abigail Adams in 1780:

>I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study
mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and
philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture,
navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a
right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary,
tapestry and porcelain.

Robert Heinlein, science fiction author:

>Moving parts in rubbing contact require lubrication to avoid excessive
wear. Honorifics and formal politeness provide lubrication where
people rub together. Often the very young, the untraveled, the naïve,
the unsophisticated deplore these formalities as "empty,"
"meaningless," or "dishonest," and scorn to use them. No matter how
"pure" their motives, they thereby throw sand into machinery that does
not work too well at best.

Dorothy Thompson, American journalist in the 1930s:

>Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome
danger, misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm
inwardly that life with all its sorrows is good; that everything is
meaningful even if in a sense beyond our understanding; and that there
is always tomorrow.

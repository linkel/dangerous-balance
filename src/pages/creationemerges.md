An array of items presents itself before you.

Humans have an easier time selecting from four items of flavors than thirty. Paralysis of choice comes into play. Overchoice, or choice overload.

To narrow down the possibilities to one is the act of creation. When you sketch, you have an infinite possibility of pencil lines you can form. As you carve each one into the white of the paper, you narrow down the possibilities. You lose options as you continue--a line that does not work with the rest of the lines generates a malformed figure. But this loss of options is necessary in the process of creating the product.

Creation conjures the image of a creator forming his product from nothing--a builder building, a crafter crafting, and where once there was nothing there is now a something. Viewed another way it is the paring down of possibilities into one end design. There are a thousand forms that iron can take. There is only one general form where iron is a cutting implement--where iron is a rake, or where iron is a shield. Of those general forms even more specificity then makes it the one unique item of that class.
Similarly, your life is a splotch of potential that is shaped into a singular design. In the act of living you create yourself. Perhaps that is why the question of “who am I” is so unanswerable. [By asking it you perturb the system.](../understandingyourself/)

From Pragmatic Thinking and Learning, by Andy Hunt:

> One of the foremost building architects of the twentieth century,

> beauty and design: “Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges
> from selection, affinities, integration, love.”
> Beauty emerges from

> Kahn explains that beauty emerges from

> from selecting among a near infinite supply
> of choices.
> The musician has a near-infinite palette combining different

> distinguishable colors to choose from. The writer has the full
> breadth of the Oxford English Dictionary (all 20 volumes; some

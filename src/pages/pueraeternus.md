You’re 21 years old. It is as though you will be young forever. It feels like you have your entire life ahead of you. Ripples of your actions push into the bright future, and all the potential that you have in yourself is waiting to burst forth. You only need to find the right thing. The right passion, the right career, the right person. Then you will unlock what you were really meant to do.

Alternately—

You have always felt that the people around you are so normal. When you go about your daily life, you notice so many details in the world around you. You are more awake than the people around you. They prattle about their mundanities while you think expansive, enormous thoughts. You know you are better and you just haven’t found what you’re good at yet. You’re different. You’re unconventional. You’re a jack of all trades, unconstrained by the shackles of society, and you have so many different tastes (in music, in art, in media) and so many different interests that you don’t ever want to trap yourself into one.

That brimming of potential when you are 21 quickly loses its shine as time trickles onward. What is this? It is the inability to sacrifice the puer aeternus.

From Edward Edinger's Ego and Archetype:

> The psychotherapist frequently sees cases of this sort. Such a
> person considers himself as a most promising individual. He is full
> of talents and potentialities. One of his complaints is often that
> his capacities and interests are too wide-ranging. He is cursed with
> a plethora of riches. He could do anything but can’t decide on one
> thing in particular. The problem is that he is all promises and no
> fulfillment. In order to make a real accomplishment he must
> sacrifice a number of other potentialities. He must
> give up his identification with original unconscious wholeness and
> voluntarily accept being a real fragment instead of an unreal whole.
> To be something in reality he must give up being everything in
> potentia.
> _The puer aeternus archetype is one of the images of the Self, but
> to be identified with it means that one never brings any reality
> to birth._

In a different book by a psychologist, we find another example of the Puer Aeturnus...

From "The Defining Decade," by Meg Jay. Chapter 5, "The Customized Life":

> Sessions with Ian did not go smoothly. Like other twentysomethings
> raised on the promise of doing anything, Ian flinched when faced
> with the here and now. A life of infinite possibilities had felt
> like a disorienting and overwhelming burden, but it had also been a
> liberating fantasy. The concept of “any thing” sounded limitless and
> exciting, while in comparison digital design sounded limiting… and
> boring.
>
> When we talked about actually moving toward a career in
> digital design, Ian balked. He did not want to “just have some
> office job and work nine to five like everyone else.” A braver form
> of self-definition dares to be affirmative. Ian needed to move from
> talking about what he wasn’t going to do to talking about what he
> was going to do. “Being against something is easy,” I said. “What
> are you for?” To Ian, claiming was conforming. By starting a career,
> he imagined he was agreeing to decades of the status quo. Saying yes
> to one concrete thing felt like saying no to an interesting or
> limitless life. In fact, it’s the other way around. If Ian didn’t
> say yes to something, his life was going to become unremarkable and
> limited. I would say, “You need to claim something.”
>
> ...
>
> And Ian would say, “But claiming something feels like losing
> everything else.” Or Ian would say, “I don’t want to settle for some
> ordinary thing.” And I would say, “I’m not talking about settling.
> I’m talking about starting. Twentysomethings who don’t get started
> wind up with blank résumés and out-of-touch lives only to settle far
> more down the road. What’s so original about that?”

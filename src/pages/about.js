    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>A German sociologist named Niklas Luhmann had a unique system to record his notes.
        By giving each card a notation at the top and subdividing numbers to allow the continuation of thoughts, 
        he ended up with a zettelkasten that was a network of all his notes over his lifetime. For a detailed writeup, see the blog <a href='http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2007/12/luhmanns-zettelkasten.html'> Taking Note</a>.
        <br>
        </br><br></br>
        This is a far paler imitation of Luhmann's system. I seek to deposit notes here that are too interesting to keep private, but not strong enough to stand alone.
        In the process, I hope to gain understanding.

It seems like there are some sufficiently-complex concepts that feed back into themselves and are as a result endlessly changing and difficult to measure. 

Hofstadter touches on something similar--the concept of "Strange Loopiness" in his book, "[I Am a Strange Loop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop)."

Consciousness seems like something sufficiently complex in this regard. The complicating factor too is that you see everything through the lens of your consciousness. That you are in your own world separate from anyone else, because all your experiences uniquely make up your brain's pattern recognition and memory storage, and everything that happens to you is filtered through your brain's way of making sense of the world.
